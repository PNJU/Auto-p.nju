#Auto p.nju
This project was written because Cee coded a plugin applicable for Mac, but Windows operating systems don't have such a tool yet. So, I spent a midnight finishing the first version.

If possible, I'll continue to develop this small project ,trying to make it easier and simpler.
##Finished Features
* Auto login
* Auto re-connect when BRAS disconnected
* Save username and password  
*Multi-user support is of course unnecessary, isn't it?*
* Show login state

##To-do List
* Seperate the login process to a new thread to speed up
* Develop a GUI-less version, such as a Windows service
